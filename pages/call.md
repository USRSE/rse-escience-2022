title: Call for Papers

---

We encourage prospective participants to submit full papers
(10 pages, IEEE format) on topics related to RSE achievements, experiences, or
solutions in eScience. A full paper is not required to participate - abstracts
(max 300 words) will also be accepted.

Possible topics include (but are not limited to):
- RSE solutions in eScience
- RSE contributions to software sustainability in eScience
- The RSE perspective on an eScience contribution
- The non-RSE perspective of collaboration with RSEs in eScience efforts

These papers will not be part of the SC proceedings, but we will ask the
authors of accepted submissions to self-publish their submissions
(after revisions, if they so choose) to an archival repository
(e.g. Zenodo, figshare, OSF). Our website will then provide links to those
self-published documents. Some submitters will be invited to present their
papers at the workshop as lightning talks or to participate as panelists where
appropriate.

Prospective participants are encouraged to submit full papers, to be included
in the eScience proceedings, though this is not required. In lieu of the official
process, we will ask the authors of accepted submissions to self-publish (after
revisions, if applicable) to an archival repository (e.g., Zenodo, arxiv). Our
website will then provide links to the self-published documents.

Accepted submitters will also be invited to present their papers or abstracts at
the workshop, after which there will be a short Q&A and then breakout discussion
sessions with the larger group of attendees.

We particularly encourage submissions from first-time conference presenters
and from members of groups that have historically been underrepresented in the
eScience community.
