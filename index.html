  <h2><center>To be held as part of
  <a href='https://www.escience-conference.org/2022/'>eScience 2022</a>,
  Salt Lake City, Utah, October 11-14, 2022.
  </center></h2>

  <p>
  Research Software Engineers (RSEs) bridge the gap between traditional software engineering and domain science research.
  These developers have a unique combination of skills to combine expertise in software development with a deep understanding
  of the scientific field for which software is being written. 
  <p>
  This workshop will present RSE contributions to scientific research through a series of talks that explore scientific project needs,
  how access to RSEs made the project successful, and how this work can be applied to future scientific research efforts. The workshop
  will be of interest to existing RSEs, potential RSEs, domain scientists, and software developers who want to understand the lessons
  from both good and bad research software engineering experiences.
  <p>
  The workshop will consist of a keynote speaker and shorter lightning talks that lead into interactive panel discussions and
  breakout groups. Results will be published as both a post-workshop report and as smaller blog posts on the US-RSE website and
  <a href='https://bssw.io/'>BSSw.io</a>. Prospective participants are encouraged to submit their papers through the formal
  eScience 2022 process, through which proceedings will be published.
