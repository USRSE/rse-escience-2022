title: Call for Papers
permalink: /call/

We encourage prospective participants to [submit full papers](https://www.escience-conference.org/2022/call-for-papers)
(10 pages, IEEE format) on topics related to RSE achievements, experiences, or
solutions in eScience. A full paper is not required to participate - short
papers (max 4 pages) and/or abstracts (max 300 words) will also be accepted,
but will **NOT** be published in the proceedings.

Possible topics include (but are not limited to):
- RSE solutions in eScience
- RSE contributions to software sustainability in eScience
- The RSE perspective on an eScience contribution
- The non-RSE perspective of collaboration with RSEs in eScience efforts

For those who choose to submit short papers and/or abstracts,
we will ask the authors of accepted submissions to self-publish (after
revisions, if applicable) to an archival repository (e.g., Zenodo, arxiv). Our
website will then provide links to the self-published documents.

Accepted submitters will also be invited to present in-person at
the workshop, after which there will be a short panel discussion and then breakout
sessions with the larger group of attendees.

We particularly encourage submissions from first-time conference presenters
and from members of groups that have historically been underrepresented in the
eScience community.
